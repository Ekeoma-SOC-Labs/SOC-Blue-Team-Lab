# Indicators Observed — Project 2 Simulation

This project used controlled lab-generated traffic to simulate suspicious patterns.
Indicators below are lab artifacts and not real-world threat infrastructure.

## Network Indicators

Destination IP:
- 10.0.2.15 (lab sensor interface)

Protocols:
- ICMP burst traffic

Behavioral Indicators:
- Single-protocol dominance (ICMP only)
- Low destination diversity
- Repeated short-duration connections
- Automated timing pattern

## Notes

These indicators come from controlled simulation traffic and are included
to demonstrate SOC investigation workflow and detection reasoning and not threat attribution.
